   <h1>Pozole Recipe</h1>
   <h2>History of Pozole:</h2>
<p><i>Pozole is an old traditional Mexican dish</i> that has orgins which dates back before the
pre-hispanic civilization of Mexico. The dish would be made and eaten during special events
<b>Back then</b> Pozole would be made with human flesh for <i>ritual sacrifices</i>.However it soon changed when the Spanish arrived and they began
using pork meat instead of human flesh.Along with the change of human flesh new ingredients were used and many other types of Pozoles were created.
Such as Pozole rojo, Pozole Verde, and Pozole Blanco some people also began to use chicken instead of pork meat.</p>
<p>My moms recipe is on Pozole Rojo which is the classic version of pozole and doesn't need too much ingredients to create. </p>
